Using Oracle Preinstall RPM with Red Hat 6

This is about setting up Oracle Linux ready for Oracle Database Installation.

Things are a lot easier these days, with the Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) checking many settings, warning you if they are incorrect and even offering you a script which will automagically fix them. DBAs have never had it so good.

As of Oracle Linux 6 the oracle-validated RPM has been deprecated. One of the main reasons for this was that “oracle-validated” as a name sounded as if it would create a validated environment for any Oracle product. With the proliferation of Oracle products and versions out there, this was becoming increasingly difficult to manage, so Oracle decided to relaunch it as the Oracle Preinstall RPM, with the name of the intended-to-be-installed product contained within the RPM name. As a result, a look at the RPMs contained in OL6U3 shows the following:

	- oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall-1.0-6.el6.src.rpm
	- oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall-1.0-6.el6.x86_64.rpm

So clearly this version is specific to Oracle RDBMS 11g Release 2. By downloading and extracting the source RPM we can see the following:
Summary: Sets the system for Oracle single instance and Real Application Cluster install for Oracle Linux 6

%description
This package installs software packages and sets system parameters required for Oracle single instance and Real Application Cluster install for Oracle Linux Release 6
Files affected: /etc/sysctl.conf, /etc/security/limits.conf, /boot/grub/menu.lst

1. Oracle Preinstall on Red Hat 6
   1.1 Get the Repository
		# cd /etc/yum.repos.d
		# wget http://public-yum.oracle.com/public-yum-ol6.repo
		
	1.2 Using a text editor, modify the file, changing the field enabled=0 to enabled=1 to reflect repositories that correspond to the machine's operating system release. 
	
	1.3 Install the oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall RPM using the yum install command
		yum install oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall
		
		This installs the dependencies and adjust kernel parameters accordingly.
		
		The yum installation logs messages about kernel changes in the file /var/log/oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall/results/orakernel.log, and it makes backups of current system settings in the directory /var/log/oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall/backup.
		
		At this point, the system is ready for the installation of Oracle Database.

2. Download Oracle 11g Release 2
