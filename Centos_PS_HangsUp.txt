I have problem with my server. Server is running centos 6 (CloudLinux Server release 6.2).  uname -a = 2.6.32-320.4.1.lve1.1.4.el6.x86_64 That is a kvm guest. On host is debian 6.

If i run command ps aux, it stuck on random process (shows some processes only), top command is working fine. htop doesn't work too (black screen).

Sometimes i cannot kill httpd process. I run kill -9 PID even several times, and nothing happens. php runs via suphp. I learned somewhere that it can be trojan. I ran strace ps aux and it stops on

open("/proc/216456/cmdline", O_RDONLY)  = 5
read(5,
If i reboot server, problem is gone but after some time it is back again .. :(

Thanks.

Are you remote to the system? Are you connecting via SSH?

This almost seems like a fragmented packet/MTU issue somewhere between where you are and the server's location. I've seen issues with text output in those situations.

To make sure it's not your side, can you connect to the server from a different location?

How does the Debian-based host system run? Is it responsive? Other than the ps aux, does the system run well?

If you suspect a compromise, run some of the steps noted here to check the system's health and verify the installed packages.

Also: My server's been hacked EMERGENCY

Web pages is slow or almost unresponsive. I am connected via SSH (putty). I have another server to that subnet ( i am not sure if it is same switch) but rack is same. With another servers all is ok. MTU is 1500 and RX/TX errors is zero (booth guest and host). â€“  Guntis Dec 4 '12 at 11:19
