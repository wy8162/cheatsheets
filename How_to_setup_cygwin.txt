1. Setup Environments - bashrc
    For Examples:
        alias ls='ls -hF --color=tty'                 # classify files in colour
        alias dir='ls --color=auto --format=vertical'
        alias vdir='ls --color=auto --format=long'
        alias ll='ls -l'                              # long list
        alias la='ls -A'                              # all but . and ..
        alias l='ls -CF'                              #
        alias awyc='cd /cygdrive/c/awy.local'
        alias workspace='cd /cygdrive/c/awy.local/workspace/e2esuite'
        export PS1="\t[\W]"
        awyc
        cd web_services

2. Setup a custom home directory instead of the default one
    For example, to use c:\awy.local as your home directory
        mkpasswd -l -c -p /cygdrive/c/awy.local > /etc/passwd; mkgroup -l -d > /etc/group

3. Setup a Windows service
    For example, you have a script called gitd:
    a. In the directory /cygdrive/c/Cygwin/usr/bin/, create a file named "gitd" with the following
      content:
          #!/bin/bash
          /usr/bin/git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/git --export-all --verbose --enable=receive-pack --detach
    b. Run the following cygrunsrv command to install the script as a service (Note: assumes Cygwin
      is installed at C:\Cygwin):
            cygrunsrv   --install gitd              \
            --path /cygdrive/c/cygwin/bin/bash.exe           \
            --args /cygdrive/c/cygwin/usr/bin/gitd           \
            --desc "Git Daemon"                     \
            --neverexits                            \
            --shutdown
       
       NOTE: you have to use Cygwin drives.
    c. Start the service:
        cygrunsrv --start gitd

4. Configure ssh in Cygwin:
    http://www.chinese-watercolor.com/LRP/printsrv/cygwin-sshd.html

    Follow the following scrips
        > ssh-host-config

        *** Info: Generating /etc/ssh_host_key
        *** Info: Generating /etc/ssh_host_rsa_key
        *** Info: Generating /etc/ssh_host_dsa_key
        *** Info: Generating /etc/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
        *** Info: Creating default /etc/ssh_config file
        *** Info: Creating default /etc/sshd_config file
        *** Info: Privilege separation is set to yes by default since OpenSSH 3.3.
        *** Info: However, this requires a non-privileged account called 'sshd'.
        *** Info: For more info on privilege separation read /usr/share/doc/openssh/README.privsep.
        *** Query: Should privilege separation be used? (yes/no) yes
        *** Info: Note that creating a new user requires that the current account have
        *** Info: Administrator privileges.  Should this script attempt to create a
        *** Query: new local account 'sshd'? (yes/no) yes
        *** Info: Updating /etc/sshd_config file
        *** Info: Added ssh to C:\WINDOWS\system32\driversc\services

        *** Query: Do you want to install sshd as a service?
        *** Query: (Say "no" if it is already installed as a service) (yes/no) yes
        *** Query: Enter the value of CYGWIN for the daemon: [] ntsec tty

        *** Info: The sshd service has been installed under the LocalSystem
        *** Info: account (also known as SYSTEM). To start the service now, call
        *** Info: `net start sshd' or `cygrunsrv -S sshd'.  Otherwise, it
        *** Info: will start automatically after the next reboot.

        *** Info: Host configuration finished. Have fun!
        >
        > cygrunsrv --start  sshd

    If you failed to start due to so called "error 1609", or blahblah, check Windows logs. If it's
    due to logon issue, the user creating the sshd service must have "Logon as service" right. Use command
    "Secpol.msc" to set it up.
        
    If you want to stop sshd:
        net stop sshd   or  
        cygrunsrv  --stop  sshd

    If the service fails to start, try (thanks to Ross Beveridge of HP for this tip)
        chown system /etc/ssh*
        chown system /var/empty  or chown sshd_server /var/empty
        net start sshd
    
    You might want to do the following too
        - mkpasswd creates a password file from Windows' user list, click here for more details.
        - mkgroup creates a group file from Windows' user list, click here for more details.

        mkpasswd   -cl   >   /etc/passwd
        mkgroup   --local    >   /etc/group
    
        NOTE: refer to the one before for how to setup a different home directory.
    
    To check if you need to manually edit the /etc/group file:
    
        cat /etc/passwd

    Look for your current Windows login name
    Then look at the fourth field. [fields are separated by colons] Note the value. 
    This value is called a GID (group ID)

        cat /etc/group

    Look for the line that begins with Users.
    Look at the third field, it should be the same as the GID above. 
    If not, edit /etc/group so that it agrees.
    
    The following commands are useful in case of any permission issue:
        chmod +r  /etc/passwd 
        chmod u+w /etc/passwd
        chmod +r  /etc/group
        chmod u+w /etc/group
        chmod  755  /var  
        touch /var/log/sshd.log
        chmod 664 /var/log/sshd.log
    
    Finally, try it
        whoami
        ssh localhost

5. To remove the Cygwin SSH
    cygrunsrv  --stop  sshd
    cygrunsrv  --remove sshd

    Go to Control Panel, Classic View, Administrative Tools, Computer Management,
    or click Start...Run...compmgmt.msc
    delete the sshd user account.

6. Generate SSH Key Pair
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "wy8162@gmail.com"

   Make sure 'ssh localhost' works by the following command:
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
        
7. Setup ssh so no password is needed to login to remote
        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote-host

8. Using Poderosa Multi-Tab Terminal
   In case you get any problem regarding Windows registry of Cygwin:
   
   You can manually add these registries.
   
        Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions]
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin]
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\mounts v2]
        “cygdrive prefix”=”/cygdrive”
        “cygdrive flags”=dword:00000022

        NOTE by YANG WANG: the '/' key is under 'mounts v2'
        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\mounts v2\/]
        “native”=”C:\\cygwin”
        “flags”=dword:0000000a

        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\mounts v2\/usr/bin]
        “native”=”C:\\cygwin/bin”
        “flags”=dword:0000000a

        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\mounts v2\/usr/lib]
        “native”=”C:\\cygwin/lib”
        “flags”=dword:0000000a

        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\Program Options]

        Open regedit, navigate to these keys, update them to the correct directory and you are set.

        For the Geeks: Portable Cygwin
        1. Export the registry key file & copy the desktop Cygwin shortcut to your Cygwin directory
        2. Burn the entire directory to a CD -or- copy to flash disk
        3. Copy the Cygwin directory to the new system
        4. Edit the keys – notepad or wordpad works well
        5. right click | merge on the .reg file (to merge the registry keys file to the system registry)
        6. Copy the icon to your desktop, make necessary changes
        7. You are set, test by launching the icon from the desktop
